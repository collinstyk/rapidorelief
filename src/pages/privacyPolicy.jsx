                    You have the choice to accept or reject Cookies through your browser
                    settings. Most browsers allow disabling Cookies or prompting for

                    adjusting mobile device settings. Deleting existing Cookies may
                    require reconfiguration of preferences during subsequent Service

                    We may display advertisements, including third-party networks, based
                    on user interests. Information for such ads may be derived from
                    user-provided data or inferred from online activity. Adherence to
                    Digital Advertising Alliance (&quot;DAA&quot;) principles ensures user
                    control over customized ads. Opt-out choices can be exercised through
                    DAA or Network Advertising Initiative (&quot;NAI&quot;) opt-out pages,
                    and opting out is applicable per browser and device. Note that opting
                    out doesn&rsquo;t eliminate all ads but ensures non-interest-based
                    content delivery. Even after opting out, tracking tools may still be
                    used for general analytics and ad delivery purposes.

                    Ensuring the security of your Personal Data is our top priority.
                    Employing a blend of physical, technical, organizational, and
                    administrative security measures, we safeguard your data from
                    unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. These measures align with
                    industry standards and cover both data transmission and storage
                    aspects. Utilizing Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, we encrypt

                    Your information is stored and processed on servers within the United
                    States and abroad, supported by industry-standard backup and archival
                    systems. While we implement robust security practices, your
                    collaboration in protecting your data is vital. This includes
                    judiciously selecting and securing your password, controlling access
                    to your devices, and signing out after accessing your account.

                <p>
                    Despite our diligent efforts, it&rsquo;s important to acknowledge that
                    no method of data transmission or storage over the Internet is
                    entirely foolproof. We do not guarantee absolute security against
                    theft, destruction, loss, or inadvertent disclosure of your
                    information, except as explicitly mandated by law.

                <p>
                    In the event of a perceived compromise to the security of your
                    Personal Data, we commit to notifying you promptly. Notifications will
                    be delivered through your provided email address, so keeping it
                    updated in your account profile is crucial. If preferred, you can opt
                    by reaching out to us at Privacy-Notice@rapidorelief.com, specifying
                    your address. Consent for email notifications is implied unless

                    data source, purpose of collection, and sensitivity are considered
                    when establishing retention periods. In certain cases, data may be
                    retained for an extended period to comply with legal obligations,
                    resolve disputes, collect owed fees, provide Services, or as

                    <p className="text-css">Exercising Your Rights:</p>
                    To exercise your rights under the CCPA, VCDPA, or CPA, you must send a
                    request providing sufficient information for us to verify your
                    identity and describing your request in detail. Each request meeting
                    these criteria will be considered a &quot;Valid Request.&quot; You
                    don&rsquo;t need an account to submit a Valid Request.
                </p>
                <br />

                <p>
                    We will respond within the required legal timeframe and won&rsquo;t
                    charge a fee unless your request is deemed excessive, repetitive, or
                    manifestly unfounded. If a fee applies, we&rsquo;ll notify you before
                    completing your request.
